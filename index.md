## General

I'm currently a PhD student in Statistics in Montpellier, France.

I am under the supervision of [Joseph Salmon](http://josephsalmon.eu/), [Benjamin Charlier](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~charlier/index.php?page=index) and [Alexis Joly](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Alexis.Joly/wiki/pmwiki.php) at Institut Montpelliérain Alexander Grothendieck (IMAG - University of Montpellier) and the INRIA Montpellier.

You can contact me at any of the following:

* [tanguy_l@outlook.fr](mailto:tanguy_l@outlook.fr)

## Research interests

* Machine Learning - Deep Learning for image classification
* Label uncertainty in crowdsourced data
* Task difficulty for human classifications

## Other interests

* Programming in data science: mostly **Python**, some **R**. Could also be in the Research interests section, but clearly this goes beyond research purposes.

* Scientific vulgarization:
    * in books: Ian Stewart with *Flatterland*, the sequel of the famous *Flatland* or *The mathematics of life* by the same author, *The godess of small victories* by Yannick Grannec...
    * in videos: [Dimensions](http://www.dimensions-math.org/) and its brother [Chaos](https://www.chaos-math.org/fr.html), [Sciences étonnantes](https://scienceetonnante.com/)...

* Comic-books: Not data-science-related, but a very good escape from it all.
