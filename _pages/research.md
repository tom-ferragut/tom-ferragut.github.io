September 2020: <i>Geodesics and Visual boundary of Horospherical Products</i>
by T. Ferragut. [Preprint]</summary>
<b> Abstract: </b>
Horospherical products of two hyperbolic spaces unify the construction of metric spaces such as the Diestel-Leader graphs, the SOL geometry or the treebolic spaces. Given two proper, geodesically complete, Gromov hyperbolic, Busemann spaces Hp and Hq, we study the geometry of their horospherical product H:=Hp⋈Hq through a description of its geodesics. Specifically we introduce a large family of distances on Hp⋈Hq. We show that all these distances produce the same large scale geometry. This description allows us to depict the shape of geodesic segments and geodesic lines. The understanding of the geodesics' behaviour leads us to the characterization of the visual boundary of the horospherical products. Our results are based on metric estimates on paths avoiding horospheres in a Gromov hyperbolic space. </details>

May 2018: <i>Elementary solution of an infinite sequence of instances of the Hurwitz problem</i>
by T. Ferragut, C. Petronio</summary>
<b> Abstract: </b>
We prove that there exists no branched cover from the torus to the sphere with degree 3h and 3 branching points in the target with local degrees (3,...,3), (3,...,3), (4,2,3,...,3) at their preimages. The result was already established by Izmestiev, Kusner, Rote, Springborn, and Sullivan, using geometric techniques, and by Corvaja and Zannier with a more algebraic approach, whereas our proof is topological and completely elementary: besides the definitions, it only uses the fact that on the torus a simple closed curve can only be trivial (in homology, or equivalently bounding a disc, or equivalently separating) or non-trivial. </details>
