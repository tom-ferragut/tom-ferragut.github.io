# Quasi-isometry rigidity of quasi-isometry between horospherical products

Key elements of the proof of the splitting property of quasi-isometry in horospherical products.

# Geodesic and Visual boundary in horospherical products

The geometry of a horospherical product are quite rigid. It allows us to provide a description of its geodedesics and visual boundary.

# Separating profil and tree witdh

Master thesis under the supervision of Jeremie Brieussel.

# Hurwitz Problem

Master internship at Pisa university, c, who made these three figures. They represent some combinatorial events for paths in a specific exagon tiling of the torus.
